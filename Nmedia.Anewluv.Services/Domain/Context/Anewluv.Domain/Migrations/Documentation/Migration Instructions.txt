Stetp one after the model and context files are created run this in PMconsole

 PM> Enable-Migrations  

 PM>  Update-Initial Catalog= -StartUpProjectName "Shell.MVC2.DOmain.Entities" -ConfigurationTypeName "ConfigurationAnewluv" -verbose -force
 PM>  Update-Initial Catalog= -StartUpProjectName "Shell.MVC2.DOmain.Entities" -ConfigurationTypeName "ConfigurationChat" -verbose -force

 

Automatic migration was not applied because it would result in data loss.

I am going through all the new modles and properly naming the lookup tables and their primary keys , just a quick update here.

So I looked into the scheme deal and you can make sure db objects are mapped to a named scheme using this fluent syntax called in the onmodelcreating method

    modelBuilder.Entity(Of log)().ToTable("logs", schemaName:="Logging")
    modelBuilder.Entity(Of lu_application)().ToTable("lu_application", schemaName:="Logging")
    modelBuilder.Entity(Of lu_logSeverity)().ToTable("lu_logSeverity", schemaName:="Logging")

or you can decorate the entiies as follows 
   <Table("log", Schema:="Logging")> _

And thwy will be automatically renamed or mapped to the correct schema.

 Below is the commad to create/modify the Initial Catalog= from visual studio and the generated script is listed for your intrest.
I like how it checks for the schema to exist and if it does’nt creates a new one which is cool.


Sample migraation command.

PM> Update-Initial Catalog= -StartUpProjectName "Medtox.Infrastructure.Entities" -ConfigurationTypeName "ConfigurationCustomlogModel" -verbose 


if you dont care if any data is deleted use the -force flag. and If you are having problems with previous migrations you can delete the migrations
table that is created in SQL

Update-Initial Catalog= -StartUpProjectName "Medtox.Infrastructure.Entities" -ConfigurationTypeName "ConfigurationCustomlogModel" -verbose –force
Update-Initial Catalog= -StartUpProjectName "Medtox.Infrastructure.Entities" -ConfigurationTypeName "ConfigurationNotificationModel" -verbose –force

check the model updating model for custom Initial Catalog= migration settings i.e schema and object relationships
 

 added this code to configure migrations to be constally updated on db changes automatically
 add-Migration -StartUpProjectName "Medtox.Infrastructure.Entities" -ConfigurationTypeName "ConfigurationNotificationModel" ConfigurationNotificationModelInitial
 add-Migration  -StartUpProjectName "Medtox.Infrastructure.Entities" -ConfigurationTypeName "ConfigurationCustomlogModel"  ConfigurationCustomlogModelInitial
